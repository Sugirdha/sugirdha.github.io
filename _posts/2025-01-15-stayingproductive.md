_Tips to help you stay productive while learning new skills._

As someone who proudly identifies as a lifelong learning enthusiast, balancing full-time work with learning new skills can be a challenge. Over time, I’ve discovered a few simple strategies that help me stay productive and keep making progress, no matter how busy life gets.

## Set Small, Achievable Goals

This is one of the most effective strategies I’ve found. Whether it’s dedicating just 30 minutes in the morning to study or breaking tasks into smaller pieces, this approach makes the learning process much more manageable. It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the big picture, but focusing on smaller, achievable chunks keeps things from feeling daunting.

## Use the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro technique is a favourite of mine. It involves 25-minute intervals of focused work, followed by a short reward break—like a cup of coffee, a quick walk, or even catching up on a few reels. Keeping the break short, under 5 minutes, prevents losing momentum, and knowing another break is just 25 minutes away helps you stay on track while enjoying small rewards. You could try using simple apps to implement this technique effectively. One of my favourites is Pomodor—it’s clean, distraction-free, and keeps you focused on your tasks without unnecessary frills.

## Try Rapid Journaling

Incorporating rapid journaling into your routine is incredibly effective. Start each study session by making a quick to-do list of what you plan to cover for the day or week. This visual list of study tasks helps you stay organized and focused. Plus, there’s something deeply satisfying about ticking off completed items—it creates a sense of accomplishment that keeps you motivated.  
After your session, take a moment to jot down key points or insights you’ve learned. This isn’t just about tracking progress; it reinforces what you’ve studied and makes it easier to revisit later. Over time, your journal becomes a personal roadmap of your learning journey and a valuable tool for exam revision.

## Understand Your Learning Style

One often overlooked but powerful strategy is understanding your learning style. For me, I’m more of a reader than a watcher. When tackling something like a cloud certification, which often relies heavily on videos, I prefer to have a PDF open alongside the content. I annotate PDFs in OneNote, syncing them to my tablet for handwritten notes, which helps me focus while watching videos. Watching videos at 1.5x or 2x speed keeps things less dragging, while going through the pdf ensures I retain focus and in turn, absorb more. These annotated notes are a lifesaver when it’s time to review or prepare for exams.

## Use Low-Tech Productivity Tools

Sometimes, the simplest tools are the most effective. Try using a timer and good old paper and pen to stay focused and avoid distractions. Unlike a phone timer, a mechanical timer eliminates the temptation of notifications. Turning a timer dial and physically writing notes creates a sense of purpose and keeps you determined. It’s a refreshing change from the constant pings of digital devices and helps you stick to the study plan without getting sidetracked.

## Consistency is Key

Small, steady steps accumulate over time, turning into meaningful progress. It’s better to spend just 15 minutes a day than cramming for hours once a week. Find what works for you and keep showing up. Remember, every small effort adds up. Start today, and you’ll be surprised at how far you can go!
