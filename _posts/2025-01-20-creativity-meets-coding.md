I've always been a visual person with a flair for coding, which is why I chose mobile app development as my first role. It allows me the satisfaction of watching people interact with what I've created. For me, this is more than just a technical job; it's an opportunity to express creativity. It often surprises people when they hear me say this. I usually get the same question: _How can creativity and coding go hand in hand?_

## Creative Problem-solving

> "Life is a continuous exercise in creative problem solving." – Michael J. Gelb

Coding is all about solving problems, but often, the key to finding the best solution goes beyond just technical expertise.

Out-of-the-box thinking is an essential skill that allows developers to find alternative ways of doing things. Not to discount the initial, sometimes seemingly far-fetched ideas that spill out of your mind; often, these are the ideas that mature into the best solutions.

Personally, it’s this blend of logic and imagination that makes coding such a uniquely satisfying creative craft.

## Attention to Detail

Little things matter a lot in coding. We all know that the small touches are what ensure everything is in place and make the app feel intuitive. But for me, attention to detail starts as early as the planning stage.

Asking the right questions and paying attention to the smallest details is crucial from the outset. Whether it’s reviewing designs or listening to client requirements, these moments of clarity early on can prevent bigger misunderstandings down the road. Taking the time to dig into those details helps clear up confusion and ensures the solution is right from the start.

## Communication and Collaboration

While it’s true that many artists may prefer working solo, collaboration still plays a vital role in both the art world and in tech. Whether it’s through feedback, working with a team, or sharing ideas with others, artists learn to communicate their ideas clearly; just as developers do through code reviews or documentation.

It's essential for code to be understood, maintained, and enhanced by teammates. When it comes to explaining a complex piece of code or seeking input on a new approach, being able to articulate your ideas is a crucial skill for any developer.

Documentation, another important form of collaboration, is an opportunity to explain complex ideas in a more accessible way. Writing good documentation and creating diagrams not only reflects strong communication skills but also a deeper understanding of the system you're working with.

_Creativity is at the heart of development_

Whether it’s approaching problems creatively, refining the smallest details, or collaborating with others, my artistic background has helped me grow as a developer.

Many believe that coding and creativity are traits that don’t often go together in a single individual, but I’ve found that the overlap between these two qualities is more common than we might think.

I believe that all developers are creatives at heart — they just may not have realised it yet.
