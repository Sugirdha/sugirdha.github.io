Duplicate this file to create a post easily.

To preview your site with drafts, run jekyll serve or jekyll build with the --drafts switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.

Finally, when satisfied, move the newly created file to \_posts folder with yyyy-mm-dd- suffix
